### Features
  - Multi-User Functionality: Users and their accounts should be manageable by both admins and the respective users themselves, allowing for creation, editing, and deletion.
  - Social Media Stream: Users should have a customizable social media stream where they can post status updates and images. This functionality should be expandable to support additional elements such as videos and location tags (though not necessarily implemented at this stage).
  - Following Other Users: Users should be able to follow other users and view their streams.
  - Likes and Reactions: Users should be able to "like" posts from other users, with provisions for expandability to support other reactions. New likes on users' own posts should be promptly indicated either directly or upon the next visit to the app.
  - Simplified Registration Process: User registration process is simplified to data input only; no full registration process is necessary.
  - Centralized Data Storage: Data is centrally stored in a suitable database.
  - Flexibility in Data Storage Components: Data storage components should be implemented with flexibility, allowing for easy interchangeability of database technologies.
